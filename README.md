# C++ Introduction:

• C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs.

• C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

• C++ can be found in today’s operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and embedded systems.

• C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

• C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS and the various versions of UNIX.

# Qt Introduction:

• Qt is a cross-platform software for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) as well as cross-platform applications.

• Qt runs on various software and hardware platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems with little or no change in the underlying codebase while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed.

• Qt is used for developing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and multi-platform applications that run on all major desktop platforms and most mobile or embedded platforms.

# Project Description:

• This is a simple C++ application to demonstrate rock, paper and scissors game using Qt framework. In this game, players have to choose one of the three options to beat the opponent or the computer itself.

• The C++ code generates a random choice by creating an integer to indicate that option. Options are: ‘1’ is for ‘Rock’, ‘2’ is for ‘Paper’, and ‘3’ is for ‘Scissors’.

• Once we have both the choices i.e. user’s choice and computer’s choice then our program compares both the choices to see who the winner is.



The C++ function, that compares both the choices, works based on the following criteria:

Rock beats scissors as it smashes Scissors.

Scissors beats paper as it cuts Papers.

Paper beats rocks as it wraps the Rock.

Show a tie if both choices match.
