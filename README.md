# Project Description:

• This is a simple C++ application to demonstrate rock, paper and scissors game using Qt framework. In this game, players have to choose one of the three options to beat the opponent or the computer itself.

• The C++ code generates a random choice by creating an integer to indicate that option. Options are: ‘1’ is for ‘Rock’, ‘2’ is for ‘Paper’, and ‘3’ is for ‘Scissors’.

• Once we have both the choices i.e. user’s choice and computer’s choice then our program compares both the choices to see who the winner is.


 # Working
The C++ function, that compares both the choices, works based on the following criteria:

• Rock beats scissors as it smashes Scissors.

• Scissors beats paper as it cuts Papers.

• Paper beats rocks as it wraps the Rock.

• Show a tie if both choices match.
